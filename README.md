PHP-Index
=========

This library provides an API to perform binary search operations on a sorted
index. The index can be a XML document, an CSV document, or an arbitrary text
file where the key has a fixed position. You can easily implement your own
index. This API comes handy on any sorted data structure where realtime search
operations are necessary without the detour of a DBS import.

Usage
=====

Have a look at the examples/ folder. You can find there examples for each
implemented index structure.
